x is equal to y
In this program, the variables x and y are initialized with the same value of 10.

The ^ operator in the if condition is the bitwise XOR operator, 
which returns a value of 0 if the corresponding bits in x and y are the same.

Since x and y have the same value, the XOR operation will result in 0. 
The ! operator then negates the result to give true, so the if condition is true and the program executes
the statement inside the if block, which prints "x is equal to y".
