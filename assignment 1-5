1. There is a missing header file. The program should include the header file "iostream" for the input/output operations and "conio.h" for the getch() function.
2. The keyword "using" should be lowercase.
3. There is a semicolon after the main() function declaration, which is not needed.
4. The loop counter variable "i" is not declared in the program. It should be declared as an integer before the loop.
5. The comma in the loop condition should be a semicolon.
6. The output statement should print the value of "i" instead of "number", which is uninitialized.

Here is the corrected one :


#include <iostream>
#include <conio.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
int i, number;
for(i=1; i<=6; i++)
{
cout<<"Value of variable i is: "<<i<<endl;
getch();
}
return 0;
}
