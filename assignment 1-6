The program has an error in the declaration of the variable name "public". "public" is a reserved keyword in C++ and cannot be used as an identifier or variable name.

Here is the corrected code:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
int my_public_variable = 10;
cout << my_public_variable;
return 0;
}
