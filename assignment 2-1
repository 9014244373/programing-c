The error in the program is that it is missing the namespace and the header file. The program should include the header file iostream and use the std namespace to access the cout object.

Here is the corrected code:

#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int i = 0;
    i = i + 1;
    std::cout << i << " ";
    std::cout << i;
    return 0;
}

Note that the return type of main() should be int and the function should return a value, which is typically 0 to indicate successful execution.
